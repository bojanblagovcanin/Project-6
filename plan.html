    <h2 id="pweek1+2">Week 1+2:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>All: Complete and Submit a Project Plan</li>
        <li>Selman: Setup Raspberry Pi as a server</li>
        <li>Foster: STM32 Programming via HAL (explain protocol, properly set filters, etc)</li>
        <li>Bojan: Work on GUI and websites, working on the front end of the project</li>
        <li>Selman: Complete Wiring Diagram and add self part of logbook</li>
        <li>Foster: Add own parts into the logbook</li>
        <li>Bojan: Website control of the Elevator</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="prest">Week 3-14:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>All: Ideas for Capstone, Final Presentation and Demo
            CAN Messages result in changes to database and GUI/Indicators
            Commands from CAN/LAN networks are sent to the controller and move the elevator / indicate floor number
        </li>
        <li>Selman: User Interface, action buttons/icons, 
            Indicators/lights etc. implemented
            User action buttons developed to make changes to UI that are reflected in the database
            User indicator buttons change - changes in database are reflected in UI
            Users are authorized/authenticated based on username/password  
            Server program provides logging data/accepts commands only from authorized users
        </li>
        <li>Bojan: User action buttons/icons implemented
            Indicators/lights etc. implemented
            User action buttons developed to make changes to UI that are reflected in the database
            User indicator buttons change - changes in database are reflected in UI
            Database set up and accepting values/commands from website
            Database has fields for logging information placed on the CAN bus
            Produced based on content in database 
            Users may operate the elevator without having to push buttons (e.g. verbally, based on schedule/time) 
            Research and Implement a CAN/LAN communication bridge
            Ensure activity in CAN network changes values in database
            Changes in User Interface/Website changes value in database and generate CAN messages
            CAN Supervisor (Raspberry Pi) relays messages between CAN/LAN Network (see sample program on Rpi)
        </li>
        <li>Foster: Displayed on webpage
            Implement a Server Program for announcing the floor numbers
            Speaker on elevator used to announce the current/next floor (speaker already connected to system)
            Research and Implement a CAN/LAN communication bridge
            Ensure activity in CAN network changes values in database
            CAN Supervisor (Raspberry Pi) relays messages between CAN/LAN Network (see sample program on Rpi)
            Additional capability that shows ingenuity
