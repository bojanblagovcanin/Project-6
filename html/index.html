        <figcaption><b>Group 3:</b> Consisting of group members Bojan Blagovcanin, Selman Bursal and Foster Phillips,
            Group 3's goal in the project is to have a running elevator and learn and experience server communication
            from both
            front end (HTML, CSS, JAVA) and back end (C, C++, etc).</figcaption>

    <h1>Team Logbook:</h1>

    <h2 id="week1">Week 1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Worked on the wiring diagram while consulting with Michael</li>
        <li>Worked on Project plan on the template from eConestoga and then transferred it over to the plan website</li>
        <li>Created a GUI for the elevator and the inside of the elevator</li>
        <li>Created various websites for the group (plan, index, about)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="week2">Week 2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Worked on the wiring while consulting with Michael</li>
        <li>Created various websites for the group (plan, index, about) and edited existing pages</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="week3">Week 3:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Little progress was made</li>
        <li>Most of the class got Covid, so we were unable to fix errors from last week</li>
        <li>Working on having same STM32 base code for each floor and operator level, plan to have each one wired in a
            way to allow each floor to Function as needed</li>
        <li>trouble shooting on Week 2 error of floor 3 push button not responding, suspected to be a debounced circuit
            issues TBD</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week4">Week 4:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Elevator control site implemented and linked from homepage</li>
        <li>UI Elements designed from self-hosted AI (Stable-diffusion)</li>
        <li>Elevator control site updated with new UI</li>
        <li>Basic website CSS implemented and updated</li>
        <li>STM32 code updated to be one code, rather than needing to change code between floors</li>
        <li>Changable Light/Dark Mode implemented on Bojan's Logbook (to be implemented to other pages later)</li>
        <li>More content added to website to address questions in Software Assignment 1</li>
        <li>More debugging was done on Elevator buttons, however no solution was found (yet)</li>
        <li>Web storage was rearranged for clarity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week5">Week 5:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>all wiring was finished and all push buttons and LED floor indicator have been wired</li>
        <li>STM broads have been fully programed to handle push buttons to call to floor no matter position,
            bottom one can call to all floors</li>
        <li>STM broads have been programed to show floor level/floor indicator LEDS, and push buttons LEDS turn
            on upon request</li>
        <li>Login page was added to demo page, and request page was made to allow user to sign up</li>
        <li>sql database was made to store user data in table to allow for login with own login info</li>
        <li>updated group website to fit Software Assm 1</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week6">Week 6:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>planning on adding a weight sensor to ensure that weight limit is not passed</li>
        <li>planning on adding a handheld panel to simulate inside elevator to allow for opening and closing doors</li>
        <li>planning on adjusting height from floor for elevator in Arduino settings</li>
        <li>working on getting elevator audio/music playing and adding elevator beep noises to help  visual impaired people</li>
        <li>integrating our demo page to work to control our elevator in real time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week7">Week 7:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>READING WEEK</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week8">Week 8:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>weight sensor notes: Load Cell Weighing Sensor that can connect to arduino allow for weight measuring </li>
