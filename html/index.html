        <figcaption><b>Group 3:</b> Consisting of group members Bojan Blagovcanin, Selman Bursal and Foster Phillips,
            Group 3's goal in the project is to have a running elevator and learn and experience server communication
            from both
            front end (HTML, CSS, JAVA) and back end (C, C++, etc).</figcaption>

        <li>Working on having same STM32 base code for each floor and operator level, plan to have each one wired in a
            way to allow each floor to Function as needed</li>
        <li>trouble shooting on Week 2 error of floor 3 push button not responding, suspected to be a debounced circuit
            issues TBD</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week4">Week 4:</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>Elevator control site updated with new UI</li>
        <li>Basic website CSS implemented and updated</li>
        <li>STM32 code updated to be one code, rather than needing to change code between floors</li>
        <li>Changable Light/Dark Mode implemented on Bojan's Logbook (to be implemented to other pages later)</li>
        <li>More content added to website to address questions in Software Assignment 1</li>

        <li>Web storage was rearranged for clarity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week5">Week 5:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>all wiring was finished and all push buttons and LED floor indicator have been wired</li>
        <li>STM broads have been fully programed to handle push buttons to call to floor no matter position,
            bottom one can call to all floors</li>
        <li>STM broads have been programed to show floor level/floor indicator LEDS, and push buttons LEDS turn
            on upon request</li>
        <li>Login page was added to demo page, and request page was made to allow user to sign up</li>
        <li>sql database was made to store user data in table to allow for login with own login info</li>
        <li>updated group website to fit Software Assm 1</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week6">Week 6:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>planning on adding a weight sensor to ensure that weight limit is not passed</li>
        <li>planning on adding a handheld panel to simulate inside elevator to allow for opening and closing doors</li>
        <li>planning on adjusting height from floor for elevator in Arduino settings</li>
        <li>working on getting elevator audio/music playing and adding elevator beep noises to help visual impaired
            people</li>
        <li>integrating our demo page to work to control our elevator in real time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week7">Week 7:</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="week9">Week 9:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Not too much was done this week because of the previous reading week and exams during this week</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Working on the Phone app and making sure it looks good. Current compatibility with iPhone</li>
        <li>Troubleshooting the potentiometers with Michael due to the elevator shooting up way too high when sent to
            the 3rd floor</li>
        <li>Getting the sensors for weight set up, calibration with Arduino code.</li>
        <li>Added more stuff for the database, all new users can be made</li>
        <li>Weight sensors were ordered and arrived, first calibrations were done</li>
        <li>Created the web app to be compatible on iPhone, users can now control the elevator from their phones</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week11">Week 11:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Getting more calibration with the phone app/adding bootstrap to all of the sites, for easier navigation</li>
        <li>Adding a Saturday mode to the Elevator Demo</li>
        <li>Added the sessions for the website to force the users to login before ever doing anything</li>
        <li>Built the makeshift scale and did more calibration for it</li>
        <li>Added a tab for profile settings, will be added to in the following weeks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week12">Week 12:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To be continued....</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Built the weight scale and had more calibration done for it, tested weights for all members of group + Michael
        and Ali</li>
    <li>Added more Bootstrap to allow for the web app (mobile) too look a lot better, and new navbar to be on all sites
        to navigate quicker between sites</li>
    <li>Added sessions so the user must login when first entering the website, and when logging out, can not access
