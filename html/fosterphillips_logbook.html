    <h1>Foster Phillips - Project 6 Logbook</h1>

    <h2 id="bweek1">Week 1:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Worked on the Project Plan on the template alongside Bojan and Selman</li>
        <li>Converted the Project Plan over from the template to a website at plan.html</li>
        <li>Discussed and gave ideas for GUI for the inside and outside of the elevator</li>
        <li>Created basic websites for Group logbook, individual logbook</li>
        <li>Discussed wiring diagram and consulted with group members on wiring diagram</li>
        <li>Setup of elevator validated and online remote connection completed</li>


    </ul>
    <h2 id="bweek2">Week 2:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Worked on wiring the elevator buttons</li>
        <li>All 4 buttons were wired</li>
        <li>All STM code was updated to include external button input</li>
        <li>One STM is not working with button, to be fixed next week</li>
        <li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="bweek3">Week 3:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Little progress was made</li>
        <li>Most of the class got Covid, so we were unable to fix errors from last week</li>
        <li>Assignment is planned to be worked on to make up for lost time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="bweek4">Week 4:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This week, the Elevator Control was integrated into the website</li>
        <li>CSS was added and implemented to change the design of the website</li>
        <li>JS was implemented for the Elevator control network</li>
        <li>Images were added to Elevator control website (Designed by self-hosted AI image generation)</li>
        <li>CSS was used to integrate images into elevator control better</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="bweek5">Week 5:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This week we primarily worked on completing the Phase 1 requirements</li>
        <li>All bugs were worked out, and the elevator now can be called to a floor</li>
        <li>Rudamentary databse was implemented</li>
        <li>A new feature was discussed, however not confirmed yet</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="bweek6">Week 6:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This week the database was expanded, with members learning how to interact with the database</li>
        <li>The elevator database was evaluated, to learn how to interact with it</li>
        <li>The new feature has not bee confirmed yet, as a group we are still brainstorming new ideas</li>
        <li>Group is working on implementing new features like bootstrap and audio to the website</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="bweek7">Week 7:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reading Week</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="bweek8">Week 8:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Exam week</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="bweek9">Week 9:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This week not much was accomplished, as we were separated for the week</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="bweek10">Week 10:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This week the group members were split betweek workloads</li>
        <li>Selman worked on setting up Phase 3 requirements, Bojan setup the mobile app, and I worked on tuning the elevator</li>
        <li>The elevator needed to be troubleshooted, as when the Arduino code was uploaded, the elevator moved in the wrong direction</li>
        <li>The motor parameters were tuned initially, however it was determined that the Arduino Code was the issue</li>
        <li>The Arduino code uploaded to eConestoga was initially the wrong code, however has since been fixed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="bweek11">Week 11:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This week we were similarly working to finish Phase 2 requirements, and preparing for Phase 3</li>
        <li>Bojan and Selman worked on Phase 2, while Selman and I worked on the weight sensor</li>
        <li>New programs were implemented for the Sabbith mode</li>
        <li>Brief interaction with database working, elevator now moved in a simple way</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="bweek7">Week 8:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reading Week, No Progress...</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week9">Week 9:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Previous week was reading week, which limited what our group could do/li>
        <li>We mostly discussed about new features and database usage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week10">Week 10:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Users can now be added to database to access website</li>
        <li>Weight sensors were received, and Selman worked on interacting with the sensors</li>
        <li>Bojan worked on creating a more mobile friendly interface for the elevator</li>
        <li>Elevator speed and limits were adjusted</li>
        <li>Much time was spent troubleshooting Arduino code, as the code posted on eConestoga was incorrect</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week11">Week 11:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Parts were 3d printed for the weight sensors, and were attached to a board</li>
        <li>Users can now be roughly weighed with the weight sensors</li>
        <li>Bootstrap added to more of the website to unify the design</li>
        <li>Sessions are now implemented, so that the user must always be logged in before entering the website</li>
        <li>New mode called Sabbith implemented, to move the elevator to different floors randomly</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week12">Week 12:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Music and sound queues added to the website for the visually impared</li>
